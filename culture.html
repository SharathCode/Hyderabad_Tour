                <h1>Culture of Hyderabad</h1>
                <p>The capital of Telangana, Hyderabad, is the sixth most populated city in India and is home to a bustling
                     multicultural society. Popularly known as the "City of Pearls" and the "City of Nizams", Hyderabad has been the
                      centre of a vibrant historical legacy, ever since its inception by the Qutub Shahi dynasty, 
                      to be later on conquered by Mughal Empire and finally falling in the hands of Asaf Jahi dynasty. 
                      The influence of this vast royal past shines even today in the culture of Hyderabad, 
                      food and iconic architectural structures such as Charminar and Golkonda Fort 
                      which stand as testaments to the city's glorious history. 
                      The locals of the town are referred to as Hyderabadis, and they have developed a culture that is
                       distinctly a mixture of both Muslim and Hindu traditions.
                </p>

                <h2>Modern Day Hyderabad</h2>
                <p>Hyderabad is a melting pot of North and South Indian cultures. The culture of Hyderabad is quite
                     distinct from the rest of Telangana and showcases strong Islamic influences inherited from the period of the Nizam rule.
                      The impact of the Islamic culture is starkly visible on Hyderabad's architecture, food, lifestyle and language. 
                      This is more evident in the old city, while the new city represents a more cosmopolitan culture. Hyderabad has a rich
                       tradition of literature and fine arts, with many museums, art galleries and exhibitions dedicated to the display of Hyderabadi 
                       heritage. Being multicultural, festivals of all ethnicities, be it Diwali,
                     Eid or Christmas, are given equal importance and celebrated with a lot of pomp and brilliance.</p>

                <p>A beautiful blend of Mughal, Nawabi and Andhra cuisines, the Hyderabadi cuisine is known for its delectable flavours, with a profound use of desi ghee, dry fruits, meats and spices.

It is made primarily of goat meat and rice and carries a distinct aroma. Nicely garnished with pudina, fried onion and boiled eggs, it is served with Dahi-ki-chutney and Mirchi-ka-salan.

                    Pheni is a dessert eaten during the festival of Diwali and Ramzan, and Muslims traditionally prepare double ka Mitha and Haleem during the holy month of Ramzan. Irani Chai, Lukhmi, and Naancut Biscuits are other notable preparations of Hyderabad.</p>
